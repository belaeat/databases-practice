# Intro

## Storing data

-   memory
    -   memory will be cleared on every boot/program start
-   disk
    -   for persistance

## disk storage

### binary file
    - data in binary format
    - images
    - audio
    - video
    - compiled programs

    -   en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures
    -   en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)

### plain text file

### bits 0 and 1
-   1 bit can represent 2 different states 0 or 1
-   2 bits you have 4 states: 00, 01, 10, 11
-   3 bits 8 states 2^3 = 2*2*2
-   binary system is base 2 positional system

-   octadecimal system use 3 bits
        421
    -   000=0 => 0*4+0*2+0*1 => 0*2^2+0*2^1+0*2^0
    -   001=1
    -   010=2
    -   011=3 => 0*4+1*2+1*1=0+2+1=3
    -   100=4
    -   101=5
    -   110=6
    -   111=7

Matt River

```

Problem: hard to process programmatically

```
made by Matt River
year 2024

Memo

This year 2024 was great start in the development of GTX series. This
new product was made by Vera River who also was attending the launch....
```

Better but still not good

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

Solution: structured text format

### XML

```xml
<document>
    <writer>
        <firstname>Matt</firstname>
        <lastname>River</lastname>
    </writer>
    <year>2024</year>
    <title>Memo</title>
    <text>
        This year 2024 was great start in the development 
        of GTX series. This new product was made by Vera River
        who also was attending the launch....
    </text>
</document>
```

### JSON

```json
{
    "writer":{
        "firstname":"Matt",
        "lastname":"River"
    },
    "year":2024,
    "title":"Memo",
    "text":[
        "This year 2024 was great start in the development", 
        "of GTX series. This new product was made by Vera River",
        "who also was attending the launch...."
    ]
}
```
<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

### structures text files
-   xml (www.w3.org)
-   json (www.json.org)
-   csv/tsv (Comma Separated Value/ Tab Separated Value)
    - handy format for transfering tabular data between spreadsheet and your program.
-   ini
-   html/css (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
-   markdown
-   svg (for images, xml file)

### Examples

#### XML
```xml
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8">

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

#### csv

```csv
firstname,lastname,age
Matt,River,25
Vera,River,27
```

```csv
"firstname","lastname","age"
"Matt","River, Jr","25"
"Vera","River","27"
```

#### ini
```ini
;this is a comment in ini file
[database]
driver=mysql

```

#### Html/css
look at markdown.md

#### svg

<svg width="200" height="200">
    <rect x="2" y="2" width="196" height="196"
        fill="lime" stroke-width="4" stroke="pink" />
